# TSoul - User Centric Milestone Project

![TSoul-Project Responsive View on all Devices](documentation/tsoulwebresponsiveness.png)

## Introduction

Welcome to the "TSoul", my User-Centric Milestone Project. This project represents a pivotal point in my journey through the Full Stack Development course where I put my digital flare into motion. It is also a unique blend of soulful music and data analytics expertise embodied in a web platform. This website serves as a central hub for TSoul, the multifaceted persona of Temitope Akingbala, where the harmonious blend of melodic artistry and analytical prowess comes to life. I am often referred to as a "Jack of all trades". I have visualised a confluence of an artist's music site and a professional consulting site to account for my dual career paths, so its more like a multiple portfolio site. 

The live version of the project can be experienced here: [TSoul Website](https://topesoul.github.io/tsoul/index.html).

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - The landing page of the website that welcomes visitors.
- `music.html` - A page dedicated to TSoul's music portfolio.
- `services.html` - Details the professional services offered by Temitope in workforce analytics.
- `contact.html` - A form to facilitate communication with TSoul.

## UX â€“ User Experience Design

The website's primary aim is to introduce TSoul as an artist and analyst, creating a platform for a wide variety of individuals, including music enthusiasts and corporate or data-centric professionals. It aligns with my personal goal to merge these distinct yet harmonious paths. 
Informed by "The Elements of User-Experience" by Jesse James Garrett, the TSoul project prioritizes an engaging and intuitive user experience, structured into five distinct planes:

---

### Strategy

My strategy here is based on a meticulously planned approach underscored by the creation of a platform that showcases TSoul's talents and services while optimizing the user journey with thoughtful interaction design.

---

### Scope

Key features of the project include:
- A rich discography section with integrated media players for TSoul's music.
- A professional services section detailing TSoul's expertise in data and workforce analytics.
- An intuitive and responsive design to ensure a seamless experience on all devices.

---

### Structure

The website's structure is designed to guide users effortlessly from one section to the next, providing a comprehensive overview of TSoul's offerings. Clear, logical navigation ensures that users can find the information they are looking for with ease.

---

### Skeleton

Employing a minimalist design philosophy, the skeleton of the site is clean and user-focused. Attention is centered on content and interactions, with a layout that is both aesthetically pleasing and highly functional.

---

### Surface

The surface design utilizes a color scheme and typography that reflect TSoul's personal brand. I utilised the fonts such as Grenze Gotisch and Sansita Swashed, and included fallback fonts to ensure wider support across various scenarios. I have also maintained a consistent theme across all pages to ensure that visual elements can engage users eand promote readability and ease of navigation especially when considering the transparent and static background cover image overlay used.

### User-Centric Approach

Understanding users is the main focus of my approach on this project. I have identified the following goals for visitors:

#### First-Time Visitor Goals
1. Understand TSoul's dual career as an artist and data analyst.
2. Navigate the website intuitively to find music or professional services.

#### Returning Visitor Goals
1. Explore new music releases or services updates.
2. Easily engage with TSoul for collaboration or service inquiries.
